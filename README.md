# Electricity Prices Forecast using Neural Networks


    To run the built project, on cmd
     - env\Scripts\activate
     - jupyter notebook
    



##### Problem description
Using a data set from OMIE daily markets electricity prices, a model using artificial neural network is built in order to forecast electricity prices multi steps ahead. This script is a development raw sample construction, of a data science project to be continued, improved and tested in order to result a production level.
